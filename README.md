# Full House Maze in Haskell

Welcome to the Full House Puzzle Game! This is a fun and challenging puzzle implemented in Haskell, a purely functional programming language. The goal of the game is to navigate a grid where the player must visit every cell exactly once.

# About Haskell
Haskell is known for its strong static typing, immutability, and emphasis on pure functions, which makes it an ideal language for building mathematical or logic-based games like Full House. If you're new to Haskell, this project is a great way to explore the language's unique approach to problem-solving through recursion, higher-order functions, and monads.

Haskell's declarative style allows us to describe the game in a natural, functional way, breaking down the puzzle-solving mechanics into clear and reusable components.

# How to Run
To create the executable, go to the src folder with the 3 code files, open a terminal
and run the following command:

ghc --make FullHousePuzzle.hs

The executable file will be called FullHousePuzzle and will appear in the folder.

In this game, you're presented with a grid, and your objective is to visit every square once, starting from a predefined point. You can move up, down, left, or right, but the challenge is to find the correct path that visits every cell only once.
